=======

KeyFrame.cc/.h:
- fixed what was probably a copy-paste error in the return statement (needed to return a vector of point depths;
    was returning a single (median) point like the method it was modeled after
- fixed method signature to include default parameter (int q = 2)
ProbabilityMapping.cc/.h:
- went through .cc file and made sure all method signatures were present and correct in the .h file
- based on Google's style-guide, made sure input arguments (non-primitives) are passed as const& and
    output arguments are pointers
