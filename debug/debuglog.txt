KeyFrame.cc/.h:
- fixed what was probably a copy-paste error in the return statement (needed to return a vector of point depths;
    was returning a single (median) point like the method it was modeled after
- fixed method signature to include default parameter (int q = 2)
ProbabilityMapping.cc/.h:
- went through .cc file and made sure all method signatures were present and correct in the .h file
- based on Google's style-guide, made sure input arguments (non-primitives) are passed as const& and
    output arguments are pointers

- moved debuglog.txt to this directory
- copied ProbabilityMapping.* to repsective src/ and inc/ files in this directory
- created stub files/methods for files included by Probability.h (ex: KeyFrame)

- the idea is that we can debug this 'minimal' version much faster here (without having
    to build all the other ORB-SLAM modules every time)

- began debugging FirstLoop (sorry, it was at the top of the file)
    -fixed namespace errors
    -depthHo => depthHo* so that can be set/compared to NULL
    -KeyFrame& => KeyFrame* since that's how ORB-SLAM passes them around
    -FirstLoop now compiles
